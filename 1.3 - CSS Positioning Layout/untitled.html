			<p>Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. They don’t want us to win. How’s business? Boomin. </p>

			<p>Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. Special cloth alert. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Another one. Wraith talk. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.</p>


			<p>Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Cloth talk. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Another one. We don’t see them, we will never see them. We don’t see them, we will never see them. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat.</p>

			<p>The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Stay focused. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Lion!</p>
